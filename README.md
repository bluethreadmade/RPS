# Rock, Paper, Scissors Javascript Game
The purpose of this exercise was to practice using javascript, including arrays, alerts, random number functions, prompts and loops.

I built this using several functions instead of nested if statements as the in class example showed in order to try out using functions and to see if I could complete it. It has a similar number of lines as the class example and the functionality is the same.

There is room for improvement, specifically in getting rid of the global variables.
